# Release Notes 1.0
## 06/23/2022
## New Features
* **Working Web-App home page** - A web-app which users can go to when hosted on a server.
* **Working top-nav-bar** The top nav-bar functions to bring user to a new page and allows quick and easy use of the site.

## Description
This is an initial representation of the code. It is the web-app which will become the application we will be using. Current functionality is the ability to traverse through multiple pages in order to get to different sections of the site. We will be filling out the abilities and functionality of the site, and will be making the web-app have more appealing visuals at a later point.
## Focus of Release
Our main focus at this release was to have functionality of the web-app between itself and other pages. As such, much of the visuals has been left to a later point at which we will be able to improve those.
